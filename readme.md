# Hello, there!

I´m André <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

I live in Cocal do Sul, Santa Catarina. At this moment I´m treading on a javascript full-stack road to start work as a web developer. My objective is to solve real-world problems by creating websites and applications that can help people´s lives.
I´m usually curious about how things work and I always like to learn more. Please enjoy some of my current projects:
